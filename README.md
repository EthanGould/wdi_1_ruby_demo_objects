# Ruby Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

We are going to learn how Ruby enables OOP. 

Ruby, like other OO languages, allows the creation of data types. So, far we've worked with some of Ruby's built-in data types such as Fixnum, String, Array and Hash. We're going to learn how to create our own data types.

We're going to do this while we create a application for the Life Insurance industry. 

We're going to define a set of _User Stories_ that a Life Insurance applicaton would have. We'll develop these stories as we discover and learn what is required from this type of application.

Along the way we'll going to learn a lot about how Ruby gives us the tools to create well designed and implemented applications and programs.

Along the way, we are going to learn about:

* Classes
* Objects and how they are created. Object are also know as instances of a class.
* Instance attributes/variables
* Defining Behavior with instance and class methods.
* Sending messages to objects.
* Instance methods. 
	* Getters - methods that expose object/instance attributes.
	* Setters - methods that allow one to set an object/instance attributes.
	* Boolean methods.
* Private and protected methods.
* Modules used as Mixins
* Modules used to create namespaces.
* Class constants.
* Scoping rules.
* Self.
* Encapsulation.
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
* YAGNI (You aint going to need it)
* Pry Debugger, stepping through code.
* Ruby's inspect method. Handy for debugging.
* Ruby 'require', just the most basic.
